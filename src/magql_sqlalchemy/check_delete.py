    is a generic API using the model name and id.

    The resolver returns :class:`.CheckDeleteResult`, which is a collection of
    :class:`.SearchResult` items.

    -   Affected - Items that will have references to the deleted item removed, such as
        many-to-many or nullable foreign keys.
    -   Deleted - Items that will be deleted along with the deleted item.
    -   Prevented - Items that will not be deleted or have references removed prevent
        the item from being deleted.

    This shouldn't need to be created directly, it's managed by :class:`.ModelGroup`.
